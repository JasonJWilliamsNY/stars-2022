This program provides students with state-of-the-art laboratory and computer science skills needed to succeed in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) in college and beyond. Students will conduct hands-on science and computer projects and participate in hands-on activities including discussions with researchers and tours of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Stony Brook University campuses. After the two-week summer program, students will also have a line of communication to mentors who can provide advice on finding future research experiences and preparing for college. High school alumni of the summer program will participate in monthly virtual and in-person meetups and projects. We support those students for applying for additional mentoring programs for research and medicine. College alumni are also provide support and invited back to contribute to the program as mentors. Ultimately, the STARS program succeeds when our students reach the career goals they have set for themselves. 2022 Important Reminders and Resources A complete reminders page gives the full listing of conduct expectations and rules.
