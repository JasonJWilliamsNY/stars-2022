In every laboratory, there are lab notebooks and they are the most important record of your work. A lab notebook is the authoritative record of how experiments were performed, and the data they generated. Here are some points to remember for our lab notebooks. Note A notebook is not your own. In a laboratory the notebook belongs to the PI (primary investigator), the person who runs the laboratory. Notebook entries should be neatly written in pen (not pencil). If needed, the notebook may also be typed. If an error is made, it should be neatly crossed out. The point is that there should be a permanent record that is unalterable. In cases of scientific fraud notebooks may be checked. Every page of the notebook (or every new entry) should have a date. We will also have a title for the various entries in our lab notebooks. There are usually two types of entries: Lab demos: Are demonstrations of techniques. You will take notes but not not necessarily do the experiment yourself. Labs: These are full labs where you and lab partners will preform the experiment. In many cases you will be provided a protocol for the lab. You should still copy the protocol into your notebook with annotations as to what you observed and notes if the protocol is modified in any way. Photos, sketches, and any other records or results should be entered in your notebook. How to use protocols in this camp Protocols posted here are typically outlines, meaning that while they contain high-level details, they are not a substitute for taking your own notes during lab. You should copy protocols into you notebook, leaving ample room for your own notes. Note Unless otherwise noted, protocols are from/adapted from the DNA Learning Center . Questions your lab notes should answer For major steps, include your notes on what is happening; what is the purpose of this step? Include your observations; is there a color change? can I sketch or include a photo of what is happening? Don't just say what you did, say what you saw. Document differences. Did the instructor say I should expect to see something I am not seeing? Did I make a mistake and add too much/little of a reagent? Include details so if something goes wrong, you can work out why that might be. Be objective; when I make descriptions am I giving estimates using objective measurable terms? For example: \"I see a ~ 3 mm pellet\", \"I collected a sample of approximately 10 grams\". Even if you don't have a scale or ruler you can give your best detailed estimates. Include your results in your notes!

Jason leads education, outreach, and training for CyVerse (US national cyberinfrastructure for the life sciences) and has trained thousands of students, researchers and educators in bioinformatics, data science, and molecular biology. Jason\u2019s focus has been developing bioinformatics in undergraduate education and career-spanning learning for biologists. Jason is founder of LifeSciTrainers.org \u2013 a global effort to promote community of practice among professionals who develop short-format training for life scientists. Jason is advisory to cyberinfrastructure, bioinformatics, and education projects and initiatives in the US, UK, Europe, and Australia. He is also a teacher at the Yeshiva University High School for Girls. Carol Carter Dr. Carter joined the Stony Brook University (SBU) faculty as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology, School of Medicine, after graduating from the City College of New York (Phi Beta Kappa), earning her PhD at Yale U and completing postdoctoral studies in virus replication and protein biochemistry at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology. At SBU, she advanced through the ranks to Professor and is an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Physiology & Biophysics. Dr. Carter leads a federally funded basic research program focused on the pathogenesis of AIDS and other viral-induced diseases and has served on the editorial boards of journals in her field and federal, state and private advisory committees. Her research centers on cellular protein trafficking mechanisms necessary for production of virus particles and how they might be targeted for anti-viral drug design. Aspects of her work have been exhibited in the Museum of Science & Technology (Chicago IL, 2000) and translated into issued or pending patent/licenses. Dr. Carter was a featured speaker at the \u201cWomen in Science\u201d workshop sponsored by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (Japan, 2006), is a member of several SBU Graduate and Medical Sciences Training Programs in Infectious Diseases, Cancer, and Genetics and has participated in teaching of undergraduate, graduate, medical, and dental students. She has been the recipient of the \u201cSBU Exceptional Service to Undergraduate Education\u201d award, was recognized by the office of the SBU President for her service in initiatives promoted by the Center for Inclusive Education, received the 2016 Suffolk County Public Service award and, for her translational work, the 2017 Long Island Innovator award. She gratefully acknowledges the enthusiastic support and encouragement of the CSHL Director David Micklos and Assistant Director Jason Williams, without whose talents, dedication and commitment this opportunity could not have been developed. Brittany Johnson Brittany is a Middle School Educator at the DNA Learning Center. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Fisk University, and a Master of Biological Medical Sciences from Mississippi College. Brittany\u2019s involvement with the DNALC began when she attended school trips and participated in a Summer DNA Program creating antibiotic resistant genes held at Central Islip High School. She was grateful for the teachers who made sure she and others had the opportunity and exposure to this style of learning. Later, while volunteering in the then Central Islip School District (CISD) Mulligan Science Center a DNALC Educator came to do a lab, eventually leading her to pursue an opportunity to start a career with the DNALC team. The DNA Learning Center sparked an interest she never forgot, and as an educator, it is her aspiration to encourage critical thinking, while creating an environment and an excitement for learning. Michelle Juarez Michelle received her BS in Plant Biology from University of California, Berkeley and her PhD in Genetics from the State University of New York, Stony Brook. Her thesis project was completed at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, describing a novel genetic interaction between two genes that controlled developmental patterning and microRNA (miRNA) regulation of the corn leaf. She completed a postdoc at the University of California, San Diego participating in a research and career development program sponsored by NIH-NIGMS (IRACDA \u2013 Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award). Her research identified novel genetic components that regulate a wound repair reaction in fruit flies. In 2013, Michelle joined the faculty at City College New York where she taught Microbiology, Genetics, and Introductory Biology. Her research interests included Drosophila developmental genetics and science communication. Michelle joined the HHMI Inclusive Excellence initiative in 2019, to support colleges and universities to build their capacity to effectively engage students from all backgrounds in science. Currently an Assistant Director, Diversity and Research Readiness at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory DNA Learning Center NYC at City Tech; working to support initiatives for diversity, equity, and inclusion practices in STEM education at high schools and 2-year colleges. Advisors and Supporters Thank you to the various supporters who have made it possible for us to make this idea a reality. Their support enabled us to refine our ideas for the camp, recruit students, and develop the curriculum. We also want to acknowledge others possibly not listed here who contributed in other ways including teachers and advisors who helped spread the word, administrators who helped distribute flyers, and anyone else who helped behind the scenes. David Micklos David Micklos is the Founder and Executive Director of the Cold Spring Harbor DNA Learning Center. His support has made it possible for us to hold this first year of the STARS program without any external funding for supplies and staff time. He originally conceived of the idea of holding a dedicated DNALC camp that would serve to support underrepresented students in STEM and embraced the opportunity to collaborate with Professor Carter and her colleagues at Stony Brook University, who were seeking a setting for such an initiative.
